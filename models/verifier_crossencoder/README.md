# CrossEncoder based on cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [Cross Encoder](https://www.sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/usage/usage.html) model finetuned from [cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2) using the [sentence-transformers](https://www.SBERT.net) library. It computes scores for pairs of texts, which can be used for text reranking and semantic search.

## Usage

### Direct Usage (Sentence Transformers)

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# Download from the ü§ó Hub
model = CrossEncoder("cross_encoder_model_id")
# Get scores for pairs of texts
pairs = [
    ['Photos show Keanu Reeves hawking T-shirts with political messages.', 'These images were altered. The original photo shows actor Keanu Reeves in November 2017, and he was not holding a shirt. \u200b'],
    ['Video shows President Donald Trump admitting he became president because of a ‚Äúrigged‚Äù 2024 election.', 'Social media posts shared a short clip of a longer video in which President Donald Trump said he will be president during the 2026 World Cup because the election was "rigged." | But Trump was referring to the 2020 election, which he lost to former President Joe Biden, and which he has falsely and relentlessly claimed was rigged. | The U.S., Canada and Mexico won a 2018 bid to co-host the 2026 World Cup. Trump was referring to the fact that had he won in 2020, he wouldn‚Äôt have been president during the 2026 event.'],
    ['‚ÄúABC issued an official statement confirming that Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg‚Äôs contracts will not be renewed.‚Äù', 'This claim originated on a self-described satire site. | An ABC spokesperson has said it isn‚Äôt true.'],
    ['President Donald Trump‚Äôs birthright citizenship executive order would affect former Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô citizenship status.', "President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order restricting birthright citizenship does not apply to former Vice President Kamala Harris. | The executive order, if it survives legal challenges and is executed, is not retroactive and will take effect starting Feb. 19, 2025. | Kamala Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964. If both Harris‚Äô parents were still on temporary visas and Trump‚Äôs order came six decade ago, perhaps Harris' citizenship would be in question."],
    ['In negotiating releases of Americans held abroad, ‚Äú(I) gave the opposing country NOTHING ‚Äî and never any cash.‚Äù', 'Former President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration released prisoners held by the U.S. government in exchange for freeing Americans held abroad. | In 2017, the Trump administration agreed to pay $2 million to North Korea for the release of a U.S. citizen detained there, but a White House official said the money was never paid.'],
]
scores = model.predict(pairs)
print(scores.shape)
# (5,)

# Or rank different texts based on similarity to a single text
ranks = model.rank(
